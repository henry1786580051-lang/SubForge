# Changelog

## v1.0.2 - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Fixed Whisper.cpp word-level transcription dropping or misplacing quiet intro speech.
- Fixed smart split output covering silent/no-speech regions by running a second source-audio timing refinement after sentence reconstruction.
- Fixed subtitle timing refinement so VAD can trim both leading silence and trailing silence instead of only subtitle tails.
- Fixed RMS pause restoration cutting through Silero VAD-confirmed continuous speech in noisy driving footage.
- Fixed repeated Whisper.cpp text fragments around chunk/VAD boundaries.
- Fixed English smart-split spacing around punctuation, including cases like `everyone, welcome` and `Torrance, California`.
- Fixed dangling English fragments such as sentence parts split after `to`, `this`, or similar connector words.
- Fixed packaged macOS builds so DeepFilterNet3 denoising is available in the app bundle.

### Changed

- Disabled Whisper.cpp internal VAD for full-audio word timestamp runs to avoid missing quiet opening speech.
- Added live transcription and smart-split UI updates while processing.
- Improved macOS packaging for bundled torch, torchaudio, static ffmpeg/ffprobe, and denoise resources.
- Added regression tests for word-level timestamp preservation, repeated ASR text cleanup, VAD timing edge trimming, smart-split punctuation spacing, dangling-tail split avoidance, and post-split timing refinement.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Fixed Whisper.cpp model selection so local Whisper.cpp transcription no longer falls through to the Jianying path.
- Fixed bundled desktop app startup and whisper.cpp binary discovery for packaged macOS builds.
- Fixed ASR task cache reuse so new transcription requests do not instantly return stale subtitle files.
- Fixed subtitle translation/optimization cache reuse so the translation page does not display old processed subtitles.
- Fixed export actions on the transcription and translation pages.
- Fixed overlapping subtitle timestamps by normalizing boundaries before export.
- Restored silence-gap handling for Whisper.cpp output while preventing adjacent subtitles from collapsing into a continuous timeline.
- Improved ASR post-processing for long subtitle spans that cover internal silence, road noise, or music.
- Added conservative sentence-final tail trimming for noisy driving footage where RMS energy stays high after speech ends.
- Fixed bilingual subtitle re-segmentation so optimized and translated subtitles keep aligned source/target lines.

### Changed

- Improved local desktop packaging with bundled ffmpeg/ffprobe resources.
- Added regression tests for ASR cache behavior, Whisper.cpp routing, subtitle timestamp normalization, translation cache invalidation, optimizer cache invalidation, backend task status, and bilingual subtitle re-segmentation.
